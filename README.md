# ComplexitySoftwareDefectsDatasets

Welcome to the GitHub that is associated with the paper 'On the Complexity of Software Defects Datasets' by Jonas Eberlein, Rachel Harrison and Daniel Rodriguez. The following describes some requirements to replicate the study. 

The file 'Datasets.zip' includes the different datasets that were extracted from the unified bug dataset. These need to be loaded into R in order to run the code.

The file 'MergedCode.R' is the final model with instructions on how to run it.

All other files were part of producing these files or show the outcomes that were attained.
